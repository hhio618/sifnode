There only are a few files in this branch you care about:

These set up the github actions environment (or any other ubuntu instance):
sifnode/scripts/setup-linux-environment.sh
sifnode/scripts/setup-linux-environment-root.sh
sifnode/scripts/setup-linux-environment-user.sh

These actually run the tests:

sifnode/scripts/start-integration-env.sh
sifnode/scripts/peggy-basic-test-docker.py

This sets up the github action (output shows up here on every push: https://github.com/Sifchain/sifnode/actions)
.github/workflows/integrationtest.yml

And right now peggy-basic-test-docker.py runs the test but doesn't actually fail;
that needs to be modified.  (Return non-zero is all you need to do to fail a github action)

We probably don't want the scripts in the scripts directory; they should move down
into the test/ tree.  There's nothing special about this branch - my plan was to 
branch from develop and just pull the relevant files out of this (and then delete it).

We'd probably like to move more of this into pure docker scripts instead of a big script
(sifnode/scripts/start-integration-env.sh) that does a bunch of things outside docker 
containers.

Things about github actions:
- run commands don't read .bashrc/.bash_profile - see the "shell" line in .github/workflows/integrationtest.yml
to see how to start a run that reads .bash_profile
- github does install go, we don't use theirs
- if you're playing with actions, I'd set up a toy repository to push to, our full build takes ten minutes
- docker exec -ti doesn't work well in actions; you don't get output, so I removed the -ti from our scripts
- the #peggy-team slack channel can probably point you in the right direction for things, particular figuring
out the behavior of the tests in peggy-basic-test-docker.py
